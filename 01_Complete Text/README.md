Little project using GPT-2 to create a program that takes a sentence as an input and creates a text based from it:


## Example Input
I love coding

## Response
I'm also a huge fan and a fanboy of open-source software. So I've been a little bit of a geek for a while now, but I think I have a lot of things to say about open software and open hardware. It's a great place to start.
